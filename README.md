# SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In this Continuous Assessment (CA), we utilize the Mask RCNN architecture with a ResNet backbone to train and infer image segmentation masks. The initial weights were pre-trained on COCO Images, and transfer learning was done onto images derived from the OpenImagesv5 dataset. The image classes are: Suit, Dress Jeans. The resulting test loss is 2.24 and the Mean Average Precision (mAP) achieved is 0.82. Lastly, 5 scoring images have been provided to showcase the modelâ€™s effectiveness in inference.
